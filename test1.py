The program is trying to determine which one of the two options would return more money after 10 days.
Option 1 pays 100 dollars a day for 10 days.
Option 2 pays 1 dollar on the first day, and it continues to double after every single day for ten days.
This program will use functions to determine which payment option is better.
function1 will be for Option 1, while function2 will be for Option 2.

function1 will return 100 * 10.
function1 will work as a loop and continue doubling the amount every day for 10 days.

If both sums are equal, the system will ouput "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
If Option 1 is greater than Option 2, the system will output "Option 1 is better"
If Option 2 is greater than Option 1, the system will output "Option 2 is better"
